## Overview

Live Demo : www.alfahrelrifananda.my.id

I create this site in summer 2025 after graduating from High School and being unemployed.

This site is create using React with Typescript and SWC, I choose React because of my curiosity with how different typescript compared to JavaScript, turned out it is not that different.

In typescript, I learn that this language is way better for debugging and finding error than JS it because you can list the type of some value to make it more explicit.

After using typescript I don't know if I would roll back to regular JS because it just the best, I would recommend typescript for anybody for making a React Project.
