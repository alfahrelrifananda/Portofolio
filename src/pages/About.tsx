              <br />
              <br />
              Im currently live only with my grandma, my parents got broke up when i was still a kid and the custody is fall into my mom hand, but we dont actually live in one roft cause the house is not enough so she need to move to a kost (small apartment) with my older brother but she would constantly visit me and give me money every week. Im rarely see my Father, last time i see him was a year ago, i dont know where he is or how his condition is.
              <br />
              <br />
              Now im focus on how i can make some money without any hand from my parent or my relative, in short im currently need a fu**ing job.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>Education</h4>
            <br />
            <p>
               Around 2013 im started my first year of Elementary School at a state school call <b>SDN BAYAN </b>but ive had a trouble when in a 3rd grade which is im rarely attend to school because of a reason until now i dont understand(probably just lazy) so that make me restart my 3rd grade after 1 year of break. but ive had to move to another school because i move out to another kampoeng call Banyuagung and the school i attend is call SDN Banyuagung 3 this time im doing great meet a lot of great friend rarely miss school day and get a decent final score.
               <br />
               <br />
               After finishing Elementary School i attend a Middle School call <b> SMPN 3 Surakarta</b> around 2019, at my first year i can say im just doing fine until a COVID-19 Came in and ive had to study at home because the restriction. ive had to experience most of my Middle School in home which is suck because, most of people say it should have been the peak of life (they probably just exaggerate) so yeah until when the COVID-19 is getting lower when im already in 3rd Grade (last semester) i can come to school with low restriction like you had to use mask, not long after that i finish my Middle School just fine. i just missed a Middle School Experience like most people had before COVID.
               <br />
               <br />
               Next i attend a Vocational High School Call <b>SMKN 5 Surakarta</b>. I didnt pick Regular High School because at a time i think to myself i need to get a job ASAP (because me and my parent have a bad financial) so i need a School that can drove me to that. And i pick this (Just to realize i was wrong). In this school i have an option to pick a major so i pick Computer Science because at the time im kinda have a interest in this field. So i just went in and Graduate.
